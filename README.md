# Basic Responsive Navbar
This little project is a responsive navbar using basic css, a little bit of javascript to toggle the menu icon at the same time that the mobile menu is displayed.

The data for the navigation is imported dynamically from the navData.js file, if you need more links just add more objects to the array and both components: TopNav.astro and Navigation.astro will be updated automatically.

The script for the functionality is in the menu.js file and it is imported in to the MainLayout.astro.

The search icon and the cart icon are just a representation of icons that can be used in the navbar but they have no functionality.

All icons are svg icons from Ic√≥nes, and that is it.

Just a nice component to keep at hand's reach for future projects.
